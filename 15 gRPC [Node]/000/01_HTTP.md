## Key Differences Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that enable communication between clients and
servers. HTTP/2 introduced significant improvements over HTTP/1.1, primarily aimed at enhancing web performance and
efficiency. Below are the major differences:

### **1. Multiplexing**

- **HTTP/1.1**: Uses one request per TCP connection, meaning each resource requires a separate connection or sequential
  requests over the same connection. This approach can lead to delays if one request blocks others[2][5].
- **HTTP/2**: Allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single TCP connection using multiplexing.
  This eliminates blocking and improves page load times[2][5].

### **2. Binary Protocol vs Text-Based**

- **HTTP/1.1**: Transmits data as plain text, which is human-readable but less efficient for machines[3][4].
- **HTTP/2**: Uses binary framing, converting messages into binary code for faster processing and transmission[3][4].

### **3. Header Compression**

- **HTTP/1.1**: Headers are sent as plain text, which can lead to significant overhead when transmitting large amounts of
  data[4][5].
- **HTTP/2**: Implements header compression (e.g., HPACK), reducing the size of headers and improving performance[4][5].

### **4. Server Push**

- **HTTP/1.1**: Relies on client requests for resources, meaning the server waits for the client to request additional assets
  like CSS or JavaScript files[4].
- **HTTP/2**: Enables server push, allowing servers to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested,
  speeding up page rendering[4][5].

### **5. Connection Management**

- **HTTP/1.1**: Persistent connections (keep-alive) reduce overhead by reusing TCP connections, but each connection is still
  limited to sequential requests[6].
- **HTTP/2**: Uses a single connection for all streams, reducing the need to repeatedly open and close connections[3][6].

### **6. Prioritization**

- **HTTP/1.1**: Lacks built-in prioritization mechanisms for loading resources efficiently[2].
- **HTTP/2**: Allows developers to prioritize which resources load first based on importance, improving user experience[2].

### Summary Table

| Feature                 | HTTP/1.1                  | HTTP/2                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Multiplexing            | Sequential requests       | Concurrent requests            |
| Protocol Type           | Text-based                | Binary-based                   |
| Header Compression      | No                        | Yes                            |
| Server Push             | No                        | Yes                            |
| Connection Management   | Persistent but sequential | Single connection with streams |
| Resource Prioritization | No                        | Yes                            |

In conclusion, HTTP/2 offers substantial performance improvements over HTTP/1.1 by addressing limitations such as blocking,
inefficient header handling, and lack of prioritization mechanisms[3][4].
