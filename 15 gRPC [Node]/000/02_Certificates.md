Here is an explanation of the purpose of each file mentioned:

### **1. ca.crt**

- This is the **certificate** for the Certificate Authority (CA). It is a self-signed certificate that identifies the CA and
  is used to sign other certificates (e.g., server certificates). It ensures trust in the certificates issued by this CA.

### **2. ca.key**

- This is the **private key** of the Certificate Authority. It is used to sign certificates and must be kept secure. If
  compromised, all certificates issued by this CA could be considered untrustworthy.

### **3. server.crt**

- This is the **server certificate**, signed by the CA. It is used by a server to establish its identity during secure
  communications (e.g., HTTPS). It is presented to clients during the SSL/TLS handshake.

### **4. server.csr**

- This is the **Certificate Signing Request** for the server. It contains information about the server (e.g., domain name)
  and its public key. The CSR is sent to the CA to request signing and issuance of a certificate (e.g., `server.crt`).

### **5. server.key**

- This is the **private key** for the server. It works with `server.crt` to enable encrypted communication and authenticate
  the server's identity. Like `ca.key`, it must be kept secure.

### **6. server.pem**

- This file typically contains a combination of the server's private key (`server.key`) and its certificate (`server.crt`) in
  a single file, formatted in PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) encoding. It simplifies deployment since both components are
  packaged together. These files are crucial components in setting up a secure communication environment using SSL/TLS, with
  `ca.crt` establishing trust and `server.*` files securing and authenticating a specific server.
