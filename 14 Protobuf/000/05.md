The difference between `protoc` and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) lies in their roles and functionality:

### **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**

- **Definition**: Protobuf is a data serialization format developed by Google. It allows structured data to be serialized
  into a compact binary format for efficient storage or transmission.
- **Components**:
  - `.proto` files: Define the schema for structured data (messages and services).
  - Generated code: Protobuf generates language-specific bindings (e.g., Python, Java, C++) from `.proto` files to
    serialize/deserialize data.
- **Purpose**: Protobuf provides a platform-neutral way to encode and decode structured data efficiently, making it ideal for
  inter-service communication and data storage.

### **`protoc`**

- **Definition**: `protoc` is the Protocol Buffers compiler. It reads `.proto` files and generates source code in various
  programming languages based on the schema defined in those files.
- **Functionality**:
  - Converts `.proto` files into classes or methods that can be used to serialize/deserialize Protobuf messages.
  - Supports multiple languages via plugins (e.g., Python, Java, Go).
- **Purpose**: `protoc` is a tool used during development to generate the code needed to work with Protobuf messages.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature           | Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)           | `protoc`                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Role**          | Serialization format                  | Compiler for `.proto` files             |
| **Functionality** | Defines and handles structured data   | Generates code for Protobuf integration |
| **Usage**         | Runtime library for encoding/decoding | Build-time tool for code generation     |

In essence, Protobuf is the framework for structured data serialization, while `protoc` is the tool used to generate the
necessary code to work with Protobuf.
