In this exercise, the **protobuf package** and **protoc** serve distinct but complementary roles:

### **Protobuf Package**

- **Purpose**: The `protobuf` package is a runtime library used to work with Protocol Buffers in Python. It provides the
  functionality to:
  - Serialize and deserialize structured data defined in `.proto` files.
  - Handle the generated Python classes (e.g., `*_pb2.py`) created by `protoc`.
- **Usage**:
  - After generating Python code using `protoc`, the `protobuf` package is needed to use the generated classes for encoding
    and decoding data.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import example_pb2
    message = example_pb2.MyMessage()
    message.field_name = "value"
    serialized = message.SerializeToString()
    deserialized = example_pb2.MyMessage.FromString(serialized)
    ```
- **Installation**: Typically installed via pip (`pip install protobuf`) and used at runtime.

### **Protoc**

- **Purpose**: `protoc` is the Protocol Buffers compiler. It reads `.proto` files, which define data schemas, and generates
  language-specific code (e.g., Python, Java, C++) for serialization and deserialization.
- **Usage**:
  - Developers use `protoc` during development to generate Python files (`*_pb2.py`) from `.proto` definitions.
  - Example command:
    ```
    protoc --python_out=. --proto_path=proto proto/example.proto
    ```
  - This generates `example_pb2.py`, which contains Python classes corresponding to the schema defined in `example.proto`.

### Summary of Roles

| Component            | Role in Exercise                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Protobuf Package** | Runtime library for handling serialized/deserialized data using generated classes. |
| **Protoc**           | Compiler tool for generating Python code (`*_pb2.py`) from `.proto` definitions.   |

In this exercise, `protoc` is used during development to generate code, while the `protobuf` package is required at runtime
to work with the generated classes.
