The numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` in the `.proto` file are **field numbers**, which are unique identifiers for each field in the
message. They play a critical role in the Protocol Buffers binary serialization format.

### **Purpose of Field Numbers**

1. **Field Identification**:

   - Field numbers are used to identify fields in the binary-encoded message.
   - When a message is serialized, only the field numbers (not the field names) are included, making the format compact and
     efficient.

2. **Uniqueness**:

   - Each field in a message must have a unique number within that message.
   - The same field number cannot be reused for another field in the same message.

3. **Wire Format Efficiency**:

   - Field numbers between `1` and `15` take only **one byte** to encode, making them ideal for frequently used fields.
   - Field numbers between `16` and `2047` take **two bytes** to encode.
   - Larger field numbers require more bytes, so it’s best to reserve lower field numbers for fields that are most frequently
     set.

4. **Compatibility**:
   - Once a `.proto` file is in use, field numbers should not be changed or reused to avoid breaking compatibility with
     existing serialized data.
   - If a field is removed, its number should be reserved to prevent future reuse.

### **Rules for Assigning Field Numbers**

1. **Range**:

   - Field numbers must be between `1` and `536,870,911`.
   - The range `19,000` to `19,999` is reserved by Protocol Buffers and cannot be used[1][4].

2. **Reserved Numbers**:
   - If you remove a field, you can mark its number as reserved to prevent accidental reuse.

### Example from Your `.proto` File

```proto
message User {
  string id = 1;    // Field number 1
  string name = 2;  // Field number 2
  int32 age = 3;    // Field number 3
}
```

- **Field `id`**:
  - Has the type `string`.
  - Identified by field number `1` in the binary wire format.
- **Field `name`**:
  - Has the type `string`.
  - Identified by field number `2`.
- **Field `age`**:
  - Has the type `int32`.
  - Identified by field number `3`.

When serialized into binary format, only these numbers (and their values) are stored, making Protocol Buffers compact and
efficient.

### Key Takeaways

- Field numbers are required for proper encoding and decoding of messages.
- They ensure backward compatibility when evolving `.proto` files.
- Lower field numbers (1–15) are more efficient and should be assigned to frequently used fields[1][4][6].
