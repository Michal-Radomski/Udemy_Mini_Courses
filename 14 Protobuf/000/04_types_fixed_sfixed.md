The `sfixed32` and `fixed32` types in Protocol Buffers version 3 (`proto3`) differ primarily in their handling of signedness
and encoding. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

### **Key Differences**

| Feature        | `fixed32`                                                                        | `sfixed32`                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signedness** | Unsigned (non-negative values)                                                   | Signed (can store negative values)                      |
| **Encoding**   | Always 4 bytes (fixed-width)                                                     | Always 4 bytes (fixed-width)                            |
| **Usage**      | Suitable for unsigned integers where values are often large (e.g., > $$2^{28}$$) | Suitable for signed integers, including negative values |
| **Range**      | $$0$$ to $$2^{32} - 1$$                                                          | $$-2^{31}$$ to $$2^{31} - 1$$                           |

### **When to Use**

- **`fixed32`**: Use when the data consists of large, non-negative integers, as it avoids variable-length encoding overhead
  and ensures consistent size.
- **`sfixed32`**: Use when the data includes signed integers, especially if negative values are common.

Both types use fixed-width encoding, making them more efficient than variable-length types like `int32` or `sint32` for
scenarios where field values are consistently large or require precise storage size.
