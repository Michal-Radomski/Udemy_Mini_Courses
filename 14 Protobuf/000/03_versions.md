Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) has evolved through three major versions: 1, 2, and 3. Each version introduced significant
changes to improve serialization, compatibility, and usability. Below are the main differences between the versions:

## **Version 1**

- **Initial Release**: Protobuf was introduced as a binary serialization format by Google but was not publicly released.
- **Limited Features**: Focused on basic serialization with minimal support for complex data structures.
- **Internal Use**: Primarily used within Google, lacking widespread adoption or documentation.

## **Version 2**

- **Public Release**: Protobuf became available to developers outside Google.
- **Required and Optional Fields**: Introduced `required`, `optional`, and `repeated` field qualifiers to define field
  presence explicitly.
- **Default Values**: Supported default values for fields.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility by using numbered tags to identify fields, ensuring older clients
  could still parse newer messages[1][2].
- **Groups**: Allowed grouping of fields, though this feature was later deprecated due to complexity.

## **Version 3**

- **Simplified Syntax**: Removed `required` fields to simplify usage and avoid runtime errors caused by missing required
  fields. Only `optional` and `repeated` qualifiers remain[2][3].
- **Default Values for All Fields**: All fields have default values based on their type (e.g., `0` for numbers, empty string
  for text)[3].
- **Enum Enhancements**: Enums are open by default, meaning they can accept unknown values.
- **Map Support**: Added native support for maps (key-value pairs), improving usability for structured data[2][3].
- **Language Interoperability**: Expanded support for more programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Go[5].
- **Removed Groups**: Deprecated the `group` syntax in favor of simpler alternatives.

### Summary of Key Differences

| Feature                   | Version 1     | Version 2                          | Version 3                |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Field Qualifiers          | Basic fields  | `required`, `optional`, `repeated` | `optional`, `repeated`   |
| Default Values            | Limited       | Supported                          | Automatic for all fields |
| Groups                    | Not supported | Supported                          | Removed                  |
| Enum Behavior             | Basic         | Closed                             | Open                     |
| Map Support               | Not supported | Not supported                      | Supported                |
| Language Interoperability | Limited       | Expanded                           | Broad                    |

Version 3 is the most widely used today due to its simplicity, improved language support, and better handling of structured
data.
