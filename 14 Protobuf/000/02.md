In the provided `.proto` file, the keyword `repeated` indicates that the field can hold multiple values of the specified
type, functioning like an array or list. For example:

```protobuf
message Person {
  string first_name = 1;
  repeated string middle_names = 2; // This field can store multiple strings.
  string last_name = 3;
}
```

### Meaning of `repeated`:

1. **Multiple Values**: The `middle_names` field can contain zero or more strings. It is not limited to a single value.
2. **Order Preservation**: The order of elements in the `repeated` field is preserved during serialization and
   deserialization[1][6].
3. **Flexibility**: It supports various data types, including primitive types, enums, and nested messages[6].

### Use Cases:

- Representing collections, such as lists of items (e.g., names, sensors, or variables).
- Storing dynamic-length data in a structured format.

### Example in Usage:

If serialized into JSON, a `Person` message with multiple middle names might look like:

```json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "middle_names": ["Paul", "George"],
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

This makes `repeated` fields ideal for scenarios where a field needs to store multiple values efficiently.
