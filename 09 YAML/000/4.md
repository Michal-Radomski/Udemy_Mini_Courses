Here are clear examples of an object and an array in YAML, demonstrating both basic and nested data structures:

**YAML Object Example**

An object in YAML is represented as a collection of key-value pairs (also called a dictionary or map):

```yaml
person:
  name: Alice
  age: 30
  city: Paris
```

In this example, `person` is an object with the properties `name`, `age`, and `city`[1][3][5].

**YAML Array Example**

An array (or list/sequence) in YAML is created using dashes (`-`) for each item, or with square brackets for inline notation:

```yaml
colors:
  - red
  - green
  - blue
```

Or, using inline (flow) style:

```yaml
colors: [red, green, blue]
```

Both forms represent an array of scalar values under the key `colors`[1][4][5].

**YAML Array of Objects Example**

You can also have an array where each element is an object:

```yaml
employees:
  - id: 1
    name: John Doe
    role: Developer
  - id: 2
    name: Jane Smith
    role: Designer
```

Here, `employees` is an array, and each item in the array is an object with keys `id`, `name`, and `role`[1][3][5].

**Summary Table**

| YAML Structure   | Example Syntax                             | Description               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Object           | `person: {name: Alice, age: 30}`           | Key-value pairs           |
| Array            | `colors: [red, green, blue]`               | List of values            |
| Array of Objects | List of objects under a key (`employees:`) | List of key-value objects |

These examples illustrate the most common ways to represent objects and arrays in YAML[1][3][5].
